## Part 1

[my solution](puzzle_11-part_1_jmt.py)

This one, like one of the earlier puzzles has quite a bit of work in setting up the initial conditions.
There was probably as much work in this as in the whole of some of the previous puzzles.
In this case I've decided to handle it programatically, as this code may be useful introduction to the 
use of nested dictionaries.  Functionally it would probably be sensible ot just hard code the initial 
Monkey stats, there are only 7 of them in the problem input, although at this point I don't know what 
part 2 will bring.


Run with:
```python puzzle_11-part_1_jmt.py```

Run with:
```python puzzle_11-part_2_jmt.py```

## Gotchas

We're assuming the data is nicely formatted, and the operations will always be of the form given in the 
example.  we're also assuming the "if false:" line is the last one for each monkey definition.
