Advent of code 2022 - Puzzle 01

https://adventofcode.com/2022/

The code and documentation here are based around python solotuibns for the online advent-of-code project.

This documentation is meant to assist with using the challenges for educational purposes, probably augmented by real-world sessions.
Hopefully you've received a message about this and know exactly what it's all about.

You should be able to clone this repo and be able to work on the puzzles without a live internet connection/

If not, you're still welcome to everything here, but please refer to the original site to see what it's all about.
This is not meant to be a showcase of the most ingenious, elegant or correct solutions, rather it's a resource to introduce python to those without a development background.
