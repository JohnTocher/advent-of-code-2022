# Advent of Code - 2022 

## Solutions in python with an educational focus

The code and documentation here are based around python solutions for the online advent-of-code project.
https://adventofcode.com/2022/

This documentation is meant to assist with using the challenges for educational purposes, probably augmented by real-world sessions.
Hopefully you've received a message about this and know exactly what it's all about.

You should be able to clone/download this repository and be able to work on the puzzles locally without a live internet connection.  
I have downloaded the datasets into the folder for each puzzle so your dont have to, that's not really a part of the problem, although downloading data from web sites may well be something we get into at some point.

If not, you're still welcome to everything here, but please refer to the original site to see what it's all about.
This is not meant to be a showcase of the most ingenious, elegant or correct solutions, rather it's a resource to introduce python to those without a development background.

You probably want to start with the .md file in each puzzle subfolder.  

## What you need

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/), pretty much any version beyond 3.6.  If you're on linux (ubuntu, or a raspberry pi), the command to run the scripts will probably be ```python3 filename.py``` rather than ```python filename.py```  
- Your favourite text editor.  I usually use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), but you can use whatever you prefer. 

*Note:* You probably *can't* do this on a vanilla SOE box, although if you really want to, come and see me and we can sort that out too.  Getting python to run pretty much anywhere else should be straightforward, but again reach out if you run into any grief.
