## Part 1

[my solution](puzzle_06-part_1_jmt.py)  

This time the puzzle input is a single stream of charaters, with no separators.
We don't need to handle this much differently, only that we will only get one "line" when we 
read the input as we have in the past.  We can then loop over the indidual characters in the 
line in much the same way.

Run with:  
```python puzzle_06-part_1_jmt.py```
