# Advent of Code - Puzzle 10 notes

## Part 1

[my solution](puzzle_10-part_1_jmt.py)

This one isn't overly complicated, but does introduce the likelihood of one of the most common problems in 
software development, the "off-by-oe" error.

The problem talks about things happening at the start of a cycle, where they are during a cycle, and what 
happens at the end of a cycle.  None of this is rocket surgery, but if you don't kepe track of it carefully 
it's easy to be out by a little bit.

I also wasted a bucket load of time on this thinking that the longer example on the web page was the same as 
the actual puzzle input.  They are about the same size, but not the same.
